# Knets Jr Enhanced Location Tracking

## Multi-Layer Location System

This enhanced version uses a sophisticated 4-tier location tracking system:

### 1. GPS Location (Highest Accuracy: ¬±3-5m)
- Uses device GPS for precise positioning
- Requires location permissions
- Best accuracy for outdoor locations

### 2. Network Location (High Accuracy: ¬±10-100m) 
- Uses WiFi access points and cellular towers
- Works indoors and with location services
- Good accuracy in urban areas

### 3. Cell Tower Triangulation (Medium Accuracy: ¬±150-500m)
- Uses cellular tower information for positioning
- Works without location services enabled
- Provides coverage in most areas with cell service

### 4. IP Geolocation (Basic Accuracy: ¬±5-50km)
- Uses internet IP address for location
- Universal fallback method
- Works on any internet connection

## How It Works

When a parent requests location:
1. System tries GPS first for best accuracy
2. Falls back to Network location if GPS unavailable
3. Uses Cell tower data if network location fails  
4. Finally uses IP geolocation as last resort

This ensures parents can always get location data regardless of:
- Child tampering with location settings
- Indoor/outdoor location
- Device configuration
- Network conditions

## Privacy Features

- No continuous tracking (only when parent requests)
- Parent-controlled activation
- Secure data transmission
- Local storage with server verification
