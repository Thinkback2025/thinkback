## Key Components

### Enhanced Location System
- Multi-layer location detection with intelligent fallback
- GPS, Network, Cell Tower, and IP geolocation methods
- Battery-optimized one-time location requests

### Device Administration
- Native Android device admin capabilities
- Remote lock/unlock functionality
- Network control and app blocking
- Schedule-based restrictions

### Parent Dashboard
- Real-time device monitoring
- Location tracking with method indicators
- Schedule management interface
- Activity logs and analytics

## Configuration

### Database Setup
The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Configure your database connection in the environment variables.

### Android APK Configuration
Update server URLs in the Android code before building:
- Development: `https://your-replit-domain.replit.dev`
- Production: `https://your-production-domain.com`

### Payment Integration
Configure UPI payment settings:
- Update UPI ID in pricing configuration
- Set up Amazon SES for invoice delivery

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment
1. Deploy to Replit using the provided configuration
2. Set up environment variables in Replit Secrets
3. Configure PostgreSQL database connection

### Production Deployment
1. Build the frontend: `npm run build`
2. Deploy backend to your hosting platform
3. Set up PostgreSQL database
4. Configure environment variables
5. Build and distribute Android APK

## Android Permissions

The Android application requires the following permissions:
- Location access (fine and coarse)
- Phone state access (for IMEI and cell tower data)
- Device admin permissions
- Network state access
- Notification permissions (Android 13+)

## Security Considerations

- All API communication uses HTTPS
- Device admin protection prevents uninstallation
- Parent codes are securely generated and validated
- Location data is only collected on parent request
- No sensitive data is stored locally on child devices
